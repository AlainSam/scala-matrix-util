scala-matrix-util
=================

A small matrix class, written in Scala, with lightweight multiplication and exponentiation for matrices of 
all numeric types and booleans, as well as a bunch of utility methods I've found useful in my projects. 
Use if you need to work with matrices but don't need the full power of a linear algebra library.
